OneVersionRemake supports pretty much any valid protocol that is used in Minecraft to determine the used version.

There is however a small exception. And that is with the `{version}` and `{userVersion}` placeholder, which only supports a selected list of protocol versions.  
The following list contains all supported protocols and what version String is returned.

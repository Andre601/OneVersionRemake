OneVersionRemake is able to support all nummerical version protocols, but only selected ones are supported in the `{version}` and `{userVersion}` placeholders themself.

OneVersionRemake downloads and uses a `versions.json` file which contains a collection of protocols and their corresponding Minecraft version.  
The default `versions.json` used by OneVersionRemake v3.9.0 and newer can be found [here](https://www.andre601.ch/oneversionremake/versions.json). The versions file for older is found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Andre601/OneVersionRemake/master/versions.json) and kept for backwards compatability.

Below is a complete list of all protocol versions supported by the default `versions.json` file mentioned above.  
You can alter your `versions.json` if you want to add or remove versions from it.

When a protocol is used that isn't listed in OneVersionRemake's `versions.json` will `?` be returned as fallback.
